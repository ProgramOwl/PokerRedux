# PokerRedux

## User Scenario: John is trying to break into the poker business, but he is tired of losing his hard earned money every night as he struggles to be a match for the pros. They always seem to know when to hold, when to fold, and how to win. Now, Jake can too. Jake uses PokerPro, allowing him to input the version of poker he is playing and input the hand. Then, just like magic, his odds of victory are displayed, along with a suggestion to call, raise, or fold at the table (accepting ante and bet inputs). Jake still has to know what cards to exchange in a draw game, but other than that he has an equal playing field against seasoned opponents.

## Target Users
People who want to learn how to play poker, and people like Jake and John.

## Project Description
Easy, non pressure way for new players to learn and understand how poker works. It will let you play poker while being able to know your odds of victory, as well as suggestions to call, raise, or fold at the table, and finally accepting ante and bet inputs.
